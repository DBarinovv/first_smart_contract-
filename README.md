# Crowdsale (ICO)
An initial coin offering (ICO) or initial currency offering is a type of funding using cryptocurrencies. It is a form of crowdfunding, in which a quantity of cryptocurrency is sold in the form of "tokens" ("coins") to speculators or investors, in exchange for legal tender or other (generally established and more stable) cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether. The tokens are promoted as future functional units of currency when the ICO's funding goal is met and the project successfully launches.
